# remember to download these you need to open an anaconda prompt to download these libraries 
#conda install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn pyserial
#this was used to download the necessary libraries to be used in the algortim to sort and isolate the waves 

#in the ancaonda prompt 
#conda activate myenv

#input this in after I do the other steps
#python

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. #will get this if done correctly

#input all these
import numpy
import scipy
import matplotlib
import sklearn
import serial
print("All libraries are installed successfully!")
and if there are no errors then all libraries were downloaded properly

#input this at the end to exit anaconda Prompt
exit()
